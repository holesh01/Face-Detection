First, open the terminal and update the package lists using the command:
sudo apt-get update

Install the OpenCV build dependencies using the command:
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev

Download the OpenCV source code using the command:
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git

Change into the OpenCV directory:
cd opencv

Create a build directory:
mkdir build

Change into the build directory:
cd build

Configure the build:
cmake ..

Compile the code:
make -j4

Install the library:
sudo make install

Finally, add the library path to the system by adding the following line to the /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf file:
/usr/local/lib

Run the command:
sudo ldconfig -v

You should now be able to use OpenCV in your C++ projects. Remember to include the following line at the top of your C++ files:
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
